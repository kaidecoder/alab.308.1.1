# Data Manipulation with JavaScript

## Objectives

- Create variable declarations using both let and const.
- Apply different types of data literals.
- Use arithmetic operators to manipulate data.
- Use comparison operators to compare data.
- Perform string concatenations.
- Implement escape sequences in strings for special characters.
- Use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
- Create effective documentation through the use of comments.

## Instructions:

- Initialize a new git repository in a local project folder and create a JavaScript file (.js) to contain your code. Within your code editor of choice (we recommend Visual Studio Code), complete the following activities.
- Use comments within your file to separate the code for each activity. Also use comments throughout the code to increase readability and explain your process where necessary. You can also use comments to make notes for yourself if you cannot figure something out and need to return to it at a later time.
- Commit frequently! Every time something works, you should commit it. Remember, you can always go back to a previous commit if something breaks. As an optional goal, create a separate branch for each of the activities and merge it into your main branch when you are finished with that activity.

## Implement the following:

## Part 1: Math Problems

- Check if all numbers are divisible by 5. Cache the result in a variable.
- Check if the first number is larger than the last. Cache the result in a variable.
- Accomplish the following arithmetic chain:
- Subtract the first number from the second number.
- Multiply the result by the third number.
- Find the remainder of dividing the result by the fourth number.
- Change the way that isOver25 calculates so that we do not need to use the NOT operator (!) in other logic comparisons. Rename the variable as appropriate.

## Part 2: Practical Math

Let’s look at a more practical scenario.
You are planning a cross-country road trip!
The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
Your car’s fuel efficiency is as follows:
At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
You have a fuel budget of $175.
The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
Set up a program to answer the following questions:
How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
How long will the trip take, in hours?
Compare the results when traveling at an average of 55, 60, and 75 miles per hour. Which makes the most sense for the trip?
Log the results of your calculations using string concatenation or template literals.
